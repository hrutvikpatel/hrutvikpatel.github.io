# BMO Half Marathon plan (May 3 2026)
VDOT is roughly 34 based on the best-effort races (5K 26:03, 10K 62:26, etc.). Wednesday and Saturday remain the only training days, so the plan leans on those two workouts to carry load.

## Pace zones (min/km)
- Easy / Recovery: **6:30‑7:05** (RPE 3‑4) – used for optional midweek recovery walks/slow jogs and Saturday long runs when volume is lower.
- Long run: **6:15‑6:55** (RPE 4, toward the faster side later in the plan). Keep these conversational even if the total is high.
- Tempo / Threshold: **5:05‑5:40** (RPE 7‑8). Start at the slower end (5:35‑5:40) and finish around 5:05‑5:15 closer to race day.
- Intervals / VO₂ max: **4:40‑5:10** (RPE 8.5‑9.5). Shorter workouts lean toward the fast end; longer interval-based sessions may sit near 5:00‑5:10.
- Race pace (Half): **5:40‑5:55** (target race pace predicted from the Runna estimate of 1:59‑2:07).

## Notes / Flags
- Weeks 12‑14 push long runs to 18‑20 km; because you only train twice weekly, keep these at the easy end of the suggested range (target RPE 4). Walk breaks are fine as needed.
- Week 18 replaces Saturday with a race on Sunday; keep the Saturday shakeout very easy or take the day off so the race hits fresh.
- Maintain the easy pace range on every non‑speed session to let the body adapt; pacing too close to tempo will undermine recovery with just two days of running.
