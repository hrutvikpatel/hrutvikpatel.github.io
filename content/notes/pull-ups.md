title: Pull-Up Progress
---

I have been trying to get better at pull ups since personal fitness class in highschool. Its like all exercies related activities, you pray once again each year that you will hit your goal of 10 confident pull ups. Not 3 sets of 10, but just a one time show of 10.

The worse year was 2021, when it was the peak of covid life and working out was non existent. My chest was pulling my shoulders in as I reached for my mouse and keyboard hoping that will change my life. One day woke up with a knot under my left scalpula (shoulder blade), it was by far the worse pain I felt, half my back was swollen, I got up, I walked 3 steps, quickly retreated to the bed as I realized I was fainting from the pain shotting up my spine. I might have massaged my back too much and the weak spot sprouted a knot. All that reaching for my machine, resulted in imbalance muscles.

Purchased a pull up bar that hung on my door, it forced me to do them more often, the most I got to was about 5 honest ones and 3 fart propelled ones. Back to no pullups again later that year.

The cycle repeated, it was hard to start doing pullups, since it was hard to see a sense of progress. Doing 3 sets of pull ups and maybe a sprinkle of negavtive pull ups was not helping. The idea of eventually reaching my goal / potential kept me coming back, but it did not keep me consistent. Progress is hard, it does not feel rewarding.

Sometimes you don't need to know the end potential, its maybe better that way. Let progess lead you there. However in this case its very obvious where progress leads me to... more pull ups.

I took a step back recently in Dec 2025, how do I feel good about each week of doing pull ups, while not feeling like I am gaining honest pull ups fast enough? Break progressive overload into such small steps that each step gives you a reward in mind to feel a sense of progress. Along with that take a video of you doing it, this helps see how you do along the way.

What I did:
- Started with 3 sets of 4 reps each.
- The catch is each rep is a negative pullup with a 5 second duration down, holding more at the top half since that tends to be my weaker spot.
- Each week increase just duration by 1 second till you reach 10 seconds.
- Once each rep is 10 second negative move onto increasing reps across all sets by 1.
- Once you reach 3 sets of 10 reps for 10 seconds each. Finally then flip to normal pullups.
- Same thing here, start with 3 sets of 5 pullups, each week increase rep by 1.

This is what it looks like: weeks 1–12 stick to negatives so you can focus on the eccentric control.
