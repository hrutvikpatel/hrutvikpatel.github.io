title: Pull-Up Progress
---

Working on pull-ups as a way to stay honest about my upper-body strength. Every few weeks I test a max set, note the grip I’m using, and look for patterns in how recovery affects reps.

So far:

- Week 1: 3 sets of 5 negatives, followed by a set of assisted reps.
- Week 2: Switched to a false grip and added a slow eccentric on the last rep; felt much tighter.
- Week 3: Hit 6 bodyweight pull-ups on the last set, still keeping the elbows tucked.

The plan is to keep logging pull-up days, sleep, and grip changes, then circle back here to reflect. All of this feeds into the broader [[notes/fitness]] topic so I can see how strength journals are evolving.
